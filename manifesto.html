						<h2>Neil's Manifesto</h2>
						<p>A university is nothing without it’s students - I want to put YOUR experience of GCU back at the top of the agenda. When I am president, I intend to implement the following.</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/neil-sa.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<h3>GCU Student Union</h3>
					<p>A union for us, the students - to have a body representing our views and ideas at our university. A union would be a student-lead organisation and a body that works with all students in particular class and school reps to give students a chance to have their voice heard. It would also give students the ability to campaign on issues that they feel passionately about and in-all, protect us the students. This would be a real chance to ensure student opinion is heard.</p>
					<h3>Better Lab access</h3>
					<p>Access to labs across the university right now is not good enough. Due to multiple different reasons current operational times prove to not be enough as the majority of labs are in use by classes for most of the time they are open. By opening labs for longer we give students more opportunity to access the resources they need to further their learning.</p>
					<h3>GCU Sport Strategy</h3>
					<p>Sports at GCU lack a real direction. The university very much allows sports teams to go out and do whatever they think is best. By working with sports teams to put together a strategy for our sport we can secure the future of our teams and give them all real goals to work towards.</p>
					<h3>GCU Student Charter</h3>
					<p>To build an official charter made by the university, staff and unions, and GCU students - This will be a set of promises to ensure that GCU achieves its goals and delivers the best possible university experience to YOU, our students.</p>
					<h3>Caledonian Court Social Team</h3>
					<p>Caledonian Court needs to have a committed team to help students come together, make new friends and forge lasting friendships by having a variety of social events. This student led team would be vital to building a community including both domestic and international students. Furthermore this team could act as a point of contact should students have problems during their stay in our student halls.</p>
					<h3>Improved Encore</h3>
					<p>To work and improve the services which our on-campus catering team provide for our students. By making students more aware of the services offered and developing these services in a number of ways we can improve our experience with Encore. Even just by improving our Swiipe rewards system and providing more card-use at Encore sites we can easily improve what we have.</p>
					<h3>Free sanitary products</h3>
					<p>Currently sanitary products are taxed due to them being described as a “luxury non-essential item”. GCU must do more and ensure the health of our students by giving out free products to all students upon request.</p>
